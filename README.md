# ✨SciJourDex✨
> Science Journal Dex

> This is a REST API built on a Java-based Spring backend, coupled with PostgreSQL as the database. It is designed for the efficient filtering and management of scientific journals using data from the Polish Ministry of Education [^1]. The API offers file upload capabilities for physical storage, with metadata carefully managed within the database. Additionally, users can manage tags associated with the scientific journals. In the future, a web scraper will be added to include additional tags.
